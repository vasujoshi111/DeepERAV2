## Project Overview

This project focuses on building a **multi-modal language model** that processes **text**, **image**, and **audio inputs**, and outputs text. The architecture combines **CLIP** for image embeddings, **Whisper** for audio transcription, and a **Phi-based model** for text generation. 

The core challenge was integrating these input types into a single model while maintaining a unified output format (text). We used **QLoRA** to optimize the projection layers, ensuring efficient training without heavy computational demands.

## Architecture and Components

### 1. **Image Processing**
- **CLIP for Image Embeddings**: CLIP extracts embeddings from images. These embeddings either:
  - **Run in Real-Time** (requires more GPU resources), or
  - **Preprocessed and Stored** to optimize inference.
- **Projection Layer**: A mapping layer transforms CLIP embeddings into a format that our Phi-based model can process. **QLoRA** was applied here for lightweight fine-tuning.

### 2. **Audio Processing**
- **Whisper for ASR (Speech-to-Text)**: Whisper handles audio inputs, converting them into text. No further training was required, as Whisper’s ASR capabilities are already well-optimized.
- **Pipeline Integration**: Whisper outputs text, which is fed directly into the LLM’s text pipeline. No projection layer was necessary for audio as the model already processes text.

### 3. **Text Processing**
- **Phi Model**: The base model for generating text. It takes inputs from either raw text, CLIP image embeddings (via the projection layer), or Whisper-transcribed text.

## Training Details

### Image Processing
- **Dataset**: The model was trained using the **Instruct 150k** dataset.
- **CLIP Embeddings**: CLIP generated embeddings for images, which were then fed through a projection layer. 
- **QLoRA Fine-Tuning**: The projection layer was fine-tuned using QLoRA, aligning image representations with the language model for text output.

### Audio Processing
- **Whisper ASR**: Whisper’s ASR output was directly integrated, meaning no additional training was needed.
- **Pipeline Setup**: The Whisper pipeline was linked to the text generation model, allowing for smooth transitions from audio input to text output.

### Text Processing
- **Phi Model Fine-Tuning**: The base text model was fine-tuned using standard language modeling techniques on text data. The image and audio inputs were integrated during inference.

## Deployment

The model is deployed using **Hugging Face Spaces**, with an interface resembling ChatGPT. Users can:
- **Enter Text**: Input text directly to receive generated responses.
- **Upload Images**: Upload an image, which the model processes to generate a corresponding text response.
- **Upload Audio/Record Audio**: Submit audio files or record live audio for Whisper-based transcription, which the model then uses to generate text.

### Deployment Features:
- **Unified Interface**: Whether you input text, an image, or audio, the output is always text.
- **Simple and Intuitive UI**: The interface is clean and minimalistic, allowing easy interaction with the model.

## Future Work

### Improvements:
- **Real-Time CLIP Embedding Extraction**: Implement real-time CLIP embedding extraction for faster and more responsive image processing.
- **Multimodal Attention Mechanism**: Incorporate advanced fusion techniques like multimodal attention to enable better interaction between inputs.
- **Interactive UI Enhancements**: Add drag-and-drop features and live audio recording for a more user-friendly experience.

### New Features:
- **End-to-End Training**: Train all projection layers and the LLM together for even better modality alignment.
- **Larger Datasets**: Use a larger dataset for both images and text to improve the model’s generalization capabilities.

## Logs and Results

The following logs and metrics were gathered during training:

- **Training Logs**: Recorded during the QLoRA fine-tuning of the projection layer.
- **Model Accuracy**: Performance results for text generation based on image and audio inputs.
- **Inference Speed**: Benchmarks comparing inference times with real-time CLIP embedding extraction versus pre-processed embeddings.
